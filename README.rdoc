This is my first ruby project. It is a party planning site.  Where users can:
1) Create and invite friends to join parties
2) Send reminder emails the day before with up to-date weather information
3) Organize friends into easy invite groups 
4) Update user profile, including user profile image
5) Set invited users as party administrators
6) Comment on parties

Rails, Sidekiq, Redis, MySQL
